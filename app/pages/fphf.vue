                <a href="https://github.com/ethmarks/fphf">fphf</a> (Fixed-Point
                Hash Finder) is a tool I made that brute-forces the SHA-256
                cryptographic algorithm to find strings that contain part of
                their own hash.
            </p>
            <h2>What does that even mean?</h2>
            <h3>SHA-256</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a>
                (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a common cryptographic
                function that takes in a string of text and outputs a long
                string of gibberish characters called a hash. For example,
                here's the hash of "Ethan is awesome":
            </p>
            <Code>
                <pre>
                    8a065cf798322fecf722768939f4ac3373a800ad7a34443d4bc22fba59fb1629
                </pre>
            </Code>
            <p>
                There's no inherent meaning to those characters, they're just
                pseudo-random gibberish. I said "pseudo-random" rather than
                "random" because if you re-generate the hash of "Ethan is
                awesome", you'll get that exact same string of gibberish. Every
                single time.
            </p>
            <p>
                SHA-256 is <em>extremely</em> sensitive to even the tiniest
                changes. Here's the hash for "ethan is awesome" (notice that the
                e is now lowercase):
            </p>
            <Code>
                <pre>
                    06e30aaabafedce2249f3807f0ba1dc53e8ffef4a98753109c0313ddccc28ed3
                </pre>
            </Code>
            <p>
                Changing the capitalization of a single letter results in a
                <em>completely different</em> hash. This property is what makes
                SHA-256 useful.
            </p>
            <h3>Fixed-point hashes</h3>
            <p>
                Fixed-point hashes are strings of text that contain part of
                their cryptographic hash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, <em>technically</em> a fixed-point hash is a string of
                text that <em>equals</em> its cryptographic hash, but it's
                effectively impossible to find a true SHA-256 fixed-point hash.
                Using all of humanity's combined computing power, it would take
                <a
                    href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%282%5E256+hashes%29+%2F+%2810%5E21+hashes+per+second%29"
                    >approximately</a
                >
                2.7x10^38 (270 billion billion billion billion) times the
                current age of the universe to brute-force a full SHA-256 hash.
                So because the term "fixed-point hash" isn't being used for
                anything, I'm commandeering it for my own purposes. From now on,
                "fixed-point hash" refers to a string that embeds the first few
                digits of its cryptographic hash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, it's pretty difficult to find fixed-point hashes. If
                you try to make an arbitrary one, it'll almost certainly be
                wrong. For example, the hash of the string "the SHA-256 hash of
                this string begins with 1234567" is:
            </p>
            <Code>
                <pre>
                    8e3d0d011011364974bc31835f6b149549c5b5579e7218ca0e6619c023a7a699
                </pre>
            </Code>
            <p>
                The hash starts with "8e3d0d0" instead of "1234567", so it's not
                a fixed-point hash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's try using the first digits of the actual hash instead of
                our arbitrary numbers. The hash of "the SHA-256 hash of this
                string begins with 8e3d0d0" is:
            </p>
            <Code>
                <pre>
                    ea1a5c1bfd87eba5ccd6746d7a29440bec4b399cba2e0174fa605ca7247bb262
                </pre>
            </Code>
            <p>
                Because we changed the string, the hash changed too. The hash
                starts with "ea1a5c1", not "8e3d0d0", so this isn't a
                fixed-point hash either.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many math explanation essays, the author will give examples
                like the ones that I've given as red herrings to make it seem
                like it's an impossible task, then explain the clever
                mathematical trick that makes it possible. However, there
                <em>isn't</em> a clever mathematical trick here. There is no
                known algorithm for reversing or manipulating SHA-256. SHA-256
                is so secure that the United States military uses it to transmit
                top-secret files. There is no easy way to find fixed-point
                hashes.
            </p>
            <p>
                But just because there isn't an <em>easy</em> way to find
                fixed-point hashes doesn't mean there isn't a way. If you just
                randomly guess-and-check hashes, you will (probably) eventually
                find one. Depending on how long of a hash you want, you'll have
                to guess anywhere from a few hundred to many trillions of
                combinations.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a seven-digit hash, the search space is 268 million
                possible hashes. I don't really want to guess hundreds of
                millions of combinations manually (please forgive my laziness),
                so I wrote some code to make my computer do it for me.
            </p>
            <h2>Using fphf</h2>
            <p>
                fphf is a tool for quickly and easily finding fixed-point
                hashes. It uses the computational power of modern consumer CPUs
                to search a hash space for fixed-points.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to use it, you'll need to
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/install/">install Git</a> and
                <a href="https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/">install Rust</a>
                (if you haven't already), then run the following commands:
            </p>
            <Code lang="bash" linenum>
                <pre>
                    git clone https://github.com/ethmarks/fphf.git
                    cd fphf
                    cargo install --path .
                </pre>
            </Code>
            <p>
                This will install fphf onto your computer. If you don't want to
                install it, you can also substitute the
                <code>cargo install --path .</code>
                command for <code>cargo run --release --</code>, which will run
                it without installing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you just run <code>fphf</code> on its own, it'll use the
                default parameters, which are to find a 7-digit fixed-point hash
                for the string "The SHA-256 hash of this sentence begins with
                #.", but you can also customize the options as described in the
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/ethmarks/fphf?tab=readme-ov-file#options"
                    >fphf options documentation</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                How long fphf takes to run depends on your hardware and the
                options you choose. fphf is written in Rust and uses rayon for
                multithreading to try to squeeze out as much performance as
                possible, but brute-forcing SHA-256 is fundamentally a
                computationally expensive task. On my 12-core laptop, running
                fphf with the default 7 digits only takes around 2 seconds.
                However, if you make it find a longer hash, it'll take far
                longer. An 8-digit hash takes about 27 seconds for my computer
                to find and a 9-digit hash takes around 14 minutes. Put
                formally, the search difficulty grows exponentially with O(16^n)
                complexity. Put informally, don't use fphf to find large hashes
                unless you're willing to let your computer work on it for the
                foreseeable future.
            </p>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Fixed-point hashes are cool. They aren't <em>useful</em>, but
                they are cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's kind of like bare-handed apple splitting. Ripping apart an
                apple with brute force requires (by my calculations) exerting
                around 150 PSI of pressure on the apple. For context, the
                recommended pressure in a car tire is around 30-40 PSI and the
                maximum pressure is 51 PSI. Putting 150 PSI in a tire would
                cause the thick rubber to explosively burst open. Nobody could
                put that much pressure on an apple using only their hands. So if
                you see someone
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F21mTojMCAc"
                    >rip an apple in half</a
                >, it seems like a superhuman feat of strength. It's
                <em>not</em> (there's a technique involving structural weak
                points in the apple) but it seems really impressive unless you
                know that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise, because it's unfathomably difficult to brute-force
                SHA-256, the existence of a known fixed-point hash (especially
                one with a custom message) implies that either you found a way
                to reverse SHA-256 or you used obscene amounts of computing
                power to find it. Either of those possibilities would be
                extremely impressive. Neither of them are <em>true</em>, but
                until someone figures that out, they'll be very impressed.
                That's the purpose of fphf: those few seconds of 'oh my god, how
                did they do that?'.

                My goal with fphf was to spread that feeling of temporary awe to
                as many people as possible by making it easy for people to
                create custom fixed-point hashes to show off.

                I also made a companion project to fphf called
                <a href="https://github.com/ethmarks/fphv">fphv</a>
                (Fixed-Point Hash Verifier). It's a little web app made with
                Svelte that calculates SHA-256 hashes in your browser and uses a
                matching algorithm to check if the input string is a fixed-point
                hash.

                To use it, simply visit
                <a href="https://fphv.vercel.app/">https://fphv.vercel.app/</a>
                and copy-paste your string into the input textbox. fphv will
                calculate the SHA-256 hash and display it in the output. If it's
                a valid fixed-point hash, fphv will display the section of the
                hash that matches the input string and add a little checkmark.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are other ways to check SHA-256 hashes (e.g. the
                <code>sha256sum</code> utility on Linux), but to my knowledge
                none of them come with built-in fixed-point hash checking.

            <!-- prettier-ignore -->
            <p>fphf is definitely not my most useful project, but it is
                probably my most fun project. I really like it and hope that you
                do too. Feel free to use it however you want. For example, you
                could include a fixed-point hash in your bio to make people
                briefly consider the possibility that you’re a genius
                cryptographer who cracked SHA-256. Anyways, the hash of this
